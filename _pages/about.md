Hi, I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

My project experience includes a range of work in machine learning, focusing on hardware, software and algorithm development. I am particularly interested in hardware software co-design for machine learning workloads.

Prior to joining Purdue University, I received my B.Tech and M.Tech degree from IIT Kharagpur, India (2014-19). During my pre-final year I received S.N. Bose scholarship which is awarded to only 50 students from all over India, by SERB, Govt. of India, DST, Indo-US Science & Technology Forum and WINStep Forward, to fund research internship for Indian students in a university in USA.
